# Merge

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/levinunnink/merge.js/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/levinunnink/merge.js/actions)

Merge is not a static site generator. It's a utilty that runs in the browser and the command line to merge html files with template data using native HTML elements and attributes.  

### Principles

- HTML + CSS first. Structure your site in static HTML. Build your layout in CSS. You don't need to use any Javascript to use merge.
- Lazy loading. The page renders when the data becomes available.
